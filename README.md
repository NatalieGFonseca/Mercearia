# Project web

In this project I used the express framework JS for the routes and migrations was connected with the database through sequelize js, another framework, and
was used the CSS for the style of the pages of application.

Another thing about this web project, it's than was applicated the CRUD with sequelize 
in than was possible create a management system.
